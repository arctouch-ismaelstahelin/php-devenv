# PHP DevEnv

A disposable basic PHP development environment. Ready in 3 simple steps (supposing you have Docker installed):

1. `git clone git@github.com:arctouch-ismaelstahelin/php-devenv.git`
2. `cd php-devenv`
3. `bin/start`

You're good to go. Just open your editor in this folder and start editing the `src/public/inex.php` file.
